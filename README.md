# 📚 Book Recommender System
This repo contains all of the code to the project "A semantic book recommender with LLMS".
There are five components to this tutorial:
- Text data cleaning (code in the notebook data-exploration.ipynb)
- Semantic (vector) search and how to build a vector database (code in the notebook vector-search.ipynb). This allows users to find the most similar books to a natural language query (e.g., "a book about a person seeking revenge").
- Doing text classification using zero-shot classification in LLMs (code in the notebook text-classification.ipynb). This allows us to classify the books as "fiction" or "non-fiction", creating a facet that users can filter the books on.
- Doing sentiment analysis using LLMs and extracting the emotions from text (code in the notebook sentiment-analysis.ipynb). This will allow users to sort books by their tone, such as how suspenseful, joyful or sad the books are.
- Creating a web application using Gradio for users to get book recommendations (code in the file gradio-dashboard.py).

This project was initially created in Python 3.11. In order to run the project, the following dependencies are required:
-kagglehub
-pandas
-matplotlib
-seaborn
-python-dotenv
-langchain-community
-langchain-opencv
-langchain-chroma
-transformers
-gradio
-notebook
-ipywidgets

A requirements.txt file containing all the project dependencies is provided as part of this repo.
In order to create your vector database, you'll need to create a .env file in your root directory containing your OpenAI API key.
The data for this project can be downloaded from Kaggle.
